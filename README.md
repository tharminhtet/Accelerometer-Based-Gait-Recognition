Senior Year capstone research project (MQP)\
**Goal**: Analyze gait patterns and Build a machine learning/deep learning system to identify subjects based on their gait\
**Stretch Goals**: Apply learned model and Build a mobile application that pops up "Hello [User]" once if it recogizes gait of the person on the phone
